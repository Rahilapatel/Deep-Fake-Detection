# Deepfake Detection (Image & Video)

This project focuses on detecting deepfakes from both images and videos using machine learning and computer vision techniques. The goal is to identify manipulated media and help prevent the spread of synthetic and misleading content.

## 🧠 Project Features

- Detect deepfakes in **images** and **video** files.
- Preprocessing using OpenCV and image manipulation tools.
- Model trained on deepfake datasets.
- Classification results displayed visually and/or via terminal.
- Supports batch processing and real-time detection.
